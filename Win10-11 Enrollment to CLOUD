Guide is for enrollment when machine is already logged in with ANY account,but you need to open powershell ISE as Admin.
Otherwise it will prevent you to gather hardwareHashes.

Open Windows powershell as admin - it will ask you for $credentials, suggesting to put line by line and press enter after each line. 

1st Method

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile C:\AutoPilotHWID.csv


2nd method - OFFICIAL VERSION from Microsoft

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
New-Item -Type Directory -Path "C:\HWID"
Set-Location -Path "C:\HWID"
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -OutputFile AutopilotHWID.csv

3rd method - While OOBE is running, you can start uploading the hardware hash by opening a command prompt (Shift+F10 at the sign-in prompt)
running the PowerShell command in the command prompt that opens, and then using the following PowerShell commands:

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Install-Script -name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Online

Suggesting you to use first method(but everything is dependable on scenario)
After you confirm the details of the uploaded device hash
Run a sync in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager
Select Devices > Windows > Windows enrollment > Devices (under Windows Autopilot Deployment Program) > ADD/NEW
WAIT few hours untill you fully manage someone computer on MS Azure cloud

Update 2 May 2023

According to microsoft the latest version of powershell script for pulling hardware hashes is:

md c:\HWID
Set-Location c:\HWID
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
Install-Script -Name Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo -Force
$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"
Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile AutopilotHWID.csv
